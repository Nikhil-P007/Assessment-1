<div class="About-Me">
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>As stated in the home page, my name is Nikhil Pinnika. As of 2021, I'm in year 9 and am a proud student of Hurlstone Agricultural High School. I have lots of friends both in this school and out and we meet on a regular basis. </p> 
	<p>My favourite food is sushi and favourite colour is probably cyan. In my free time, I usually play video games or play sports outside. I play for a club cricket team called Winston Hills Cricket Club and this year I would be in the Under 15's team.</p>
	<p>I'm a people-person, a extrovert who doesn't want to stay home but go out and meet others. I am quite intuitive amd creative and have a fairly open-mind. My strongest subject would most likely be maths where as my weakest would be PDHPE. My favourite subject in school, however, is commerce.</p>
