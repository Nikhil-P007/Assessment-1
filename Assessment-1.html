<div class="Question-1">
	<h2>Question 1: Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW): Explain how the web works, the role of web servers, what are web browsers?</h2>
	<p>The web provides users with access to a wide variety of documents that are electronically linked. These connections are known as hypertext links, hyperlinks, or hotlinks. Hypertext is a system that creates a network or branch structure and allows direct jumps to related information. Hypertext links are usually indicated by highlighting a word or phrase with a different color or font. When you select a link, additional information is displayed, such as: the definition of a word, a multimedia or associated website. Web files are encoded using a format system known as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This system enables the display of text, graphics and audio obtained from the Internet. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables.</p>
	<p>A web server is software program and/or hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main role of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users. </p>
	<p>A user accesses a web page through a computer program called a web browser. A web browser is an application or software which is used to view and access a wide variety of websites. Some common examples include Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox. The browser's main role is to interpret the HTML tags and display the headings, paragraphs, tables and layouts that match the screen size and the available fonts.</p>

<div class="Question-2">
	<h2>Question 2: How is the world wide web different to the internet?</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web is a variety of billions of pages which can be accessed through a device when you are online. The internet, however, is a network of millions of computers that are used for data transmission. Files and emails are some of the things that can be sent over the internet. The relationship that exists between the internet and World Wide Web is that the Web runs on one of the many paths that the internet provides.</p>

<div class="Question-3">
	<h2>Question 3: What is an intranet? How does it relate to the internet?</h2>
	<p>An intranet is a computer network that exists within an organisation, usually excluded from outsiders. The network can be used for sharing information, collaboration tools and operational systems. Both the intranet and internet are networks but their differences are that the internet can be accessed by everyone while an intranet can only be accessed by a restricted amount of authorised people.</p>
</div>

<div class="Question-4">
	<h2>Question 4: What is an internet protocol? Compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP.</h2>
	<p>An internet protocol is the protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the internet. TCP/IP is used for networking computers and communicating through the internet. Both the HTTP and FTP rely on on the TCP/IP for communicating. FTP most effective and efficient for transferring large files and HTTP is best for transferring smaller files like web pages. Although both utilise TCP/IP, HTTP uses a persistent connection, thus making the TCP/IP performance better with HTTP rather than FTP.</p>
